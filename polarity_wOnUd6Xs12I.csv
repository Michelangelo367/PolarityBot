Have you seen an increase in viewing time as you make these chatting with videos longer Or shorter? Is there a paradoxical effect, like if you make the video longer in this style people actually watch it MORE? I agree Visual component is key; even if its a podcast style discussion, it's the ability to view the host and guest's body language that keeps people intrigued. Does the content matter at all, or is it simply the discussion in an open unscripted setting & on camera? Cool."
