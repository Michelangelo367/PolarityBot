0.0,0.873,0.127,0.9366,"Hey John, a book I think you would love is Walden by Henry David Thoreau. It has a lot of old English, so it'll be a small challenge (probably not for you, though, lol.) It's recommend in the back of The 4 Hour Work Week, which is how I found out about it. Essentially, it is an autobiography of Thoreau who decides that during his busy life he was going to take a break and build a cabin off of Walden Pond. There, he lives off of nature, and writes about his life and philosophies of simple living and the materialistic world he lived in (lessons that can be applied even more so today). Its definitely an awesome read!"

Aside from his incredible journey it explores  poverty in ""white America"" or what folks sometimes refer to as communities of ""rednecks"". 2)The Road to Character by David Brooks. Talks about the difference between resumé virtues (which we live for) and eulogy virtues (which we aspire to but rarely make any progress on). The author gives a lot of examples from history and how our values as a society have changed so much overtime. 3) A World of Three Zeros by Muhammad Yunus Noble Peace Prize Winner who developed the idea of microcredits which have helped millions of people get out of poverty, or at least improve their life and their opportunities. Here he discussed how capitalism does not work anymore, and how we have to look at new models in society that are more inclusive and don't concentrate wealth, don't contaminate the environment etc..Happy reading.

That means it explains, very concisely, how perception works ... and in turn how you learn, how you are influenced, and how you can be happy.Also, 10% Happier is an excellent book.And finally, Getting Things Done ... which is not a 'book' but an introduction to bringing order, removing chaos, from your life."

Is it about learning or about a numerical challenge ? And do you target books of a certain size or a category to achieve this goal ? Because I think there are some books you cant read in a week, even if you wanted to, even if you were a super fast reader, especially if you're studying/working. Some books that are big in size and in content, profound or/and complex need time to grasp, and to reflect upon, to take notes.. sometimes it's also beneficial to read, stop, exchange with someone about an idea, take notes, and then go back to reading..this is, for me, the main idea behind reading, its main purpose..sometimes you learn more if you exchange about a book and reflect upon it than when you only focus on finishing the book..sometimes you learn more from reading one book in a month or half a month than when you do every week..Im not saying you're not doing all this, Im just saying this should not be solely about numbers..

Some books, like the one from Frankl, need to be read and 'digested' slowly. You also need to get back to them more times and re-read some parts to really understand them. Also, given your age, you may find some part more relevant than others but as you mature and grow, other parts, ideas may appeal too you more. The opposite goes for the books you find 'shallow', boring...Do not feel like you have to read/ listen to them till the end. Wish you insipring reading!"

It made me google a lot of things, always a good sign. Kind of a life story with a lot of switches, personal catastrophes beginning in the youth of the protagonist during an exhibition of arts in New York, kind of a main character is a  special little painting... I kind of resisted to read it, there was such a hype about it, but put it on my birthday wish list, now I'm glad to know it.   Viktor Frankl is one of my kind of life coaches through his books, the same for Mihail Czis....you know whom I mean:-). Now I'll search for Mary Olivers poems, sounds touching, thank you! I'm retired now and ENJOY the reading time I now have, but during my whole ( reading) life I've never stopped reading daily, except some days of heavy sickness...my all time favourites are biographies. One of the most impressing among them: THE GLASS CASTLE. Happy reading ( like my favourite booktuber HELENE JEPPESEN from Denmark always says at the end of her videos ), Monika❣"

0.042,0.748,0.21,0.9919,"Still in the middle of the video and so far I love it! I just wanted to add my very basic two cents about Richard Bach's book. While I understand your point, what I got from Jonathan Livingston Seagull (it's so weird to write that, the name is very different in portuguese haha) was not to give up on your dreams. Despite the assumptions made by others/society/family/tradition of what you can or should be doing; of who you are and how you should be. Maybe that's just the kid's version of the book, but I really got a sense of hope, persistence and passion (to follow your dreams) from it. As in, yes, you are a seagull, but you can fly low, you can reach the skies, you can twirl. You fight for your dream, you never give up, and your legacy - if there is one - is a new outlook on ""human""/seagull capability. What was once impossible, like flying to the moon, was now possible. This is why I loved the book so much. Please note that this comment is in no way trying to combate your opinion. Books are there to offer the reader their own subjective reading. I just felt like sharing. Thank YOU for sharing your thoughts and growth. I appreciate learning from and with you."

I learned so much from Asimov's books and stories that you cannot immagine. As well as for Bradbury and Dick.According to me, what change life is that you started this process and at the end of it you will be a better man, but simply because of the commitment that it takes, not for all the stupid things that are written on those books."

Reading should be fun, and it is! When you find the one you truly like. So you’re reading a book you don’t like but hey you gotta finish it cause you gotta check 1 book a week lol I personally disagree, and prefer not to count the number of books I read a year just because I enjoy the whole experience of reading when It’s a book I like, and it doesn’t feel like a chore, as I’m not trying to achieve anything or not pressured to finish it, it just feels more natural and enjoyable 😊"
